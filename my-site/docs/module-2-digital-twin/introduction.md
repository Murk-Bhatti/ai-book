# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

This module focuses on building **digital twins** for Physical AI systems. You will learn how to simulate robots and environments using Gazebo and Unity, enabling safe testing, realistic physics, and human-robot interaction before real-world deployment.

A **digital twin** is a virtual replica of a physical robot and its environment that mirrors real-world behavior. This enables AI systems to train, test, and iterate without the cost, time, and risk of physical hardware.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

- Completed **Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals** (nodes, topics, URDF)
- Basic understanding of 3D graphics concepts
- A working ROS 2 Humble installation

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand** the role of digital twins in robotics development
2. **Simulate** physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
3. **Use** Unity for high-fidelity rendering and interaction scenarios
4. **Simulate** sensors for AI perception systems

## Module Structure

| Chapter | Topic | Key Skills |
|---------|-------|------------|
| [Chapter 1](./chapter-1-digital-twins) | Digital Twins for Physical AI | Concepts, Gazebo vs. Unity |
| [Chapter 2](./chapter-2-gazebo-physics) | Physics Simulation with Gazebo | SDF, URDF spawning, physics |
| [Chapter 3](./chapter-3-unity-rendering) | High-Fidelity Rendering with Unity | ROS-Unity integration |
| [Chapter 4](./chapter-4-sensor-simulation) | Simulating Sensors for AI | Camera, LiDAR, IMU |

## Why Digital Twins Matter

Training AI for physical robots in the real world is:

- **Expensive**: Hardware costs, maintenance, and repairs
- **Slow**: Real-time training limits iteration speed
- **Dangerous**: Untested behaviors can damage robots or harm humans
- **Limited**: Hard to generate diverse training scenarios

Digital twins solve these problems by providing a virtual environment where AI can:

- Train millions of episodes in hours instead of months
- Fail safely without physical consequences
- Experience scenarios impossible to create in reality
- Generate unlimited labeled training data

## Getting Started

Begin with [Chapter 1: Digital Twins for Physical AI](./chapter-1-digital-twins) to understand the foundational concepts before diving into hands-on simulation work.
